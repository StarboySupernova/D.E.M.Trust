    Post(imageURL: "post1", postName: "Organizational Overview", postText: "Disaster and Environmental Management Trust (D.E.M.T.) is a registered community non-governmental organization whose interventions are predominantly focused on the grassroots community. D.E.M.T. operates at subnational level in Mashonaland East province of Zimbabwe and it has presence in Mudzi, Murehwa, UMP and Mutoko districts, and is headquartered in Mutoko, where it has a running and current memorandum of understanding with the Mutoko local government. The organization was founded in 2019 with a program focused on Resilience Building and Community development and it implements various interventions including water and sanitation, climate-smart agriculture and community infrastructure rehabilitation in partnership with the local authority. D.E.M.T.’s mission is to build the capacities of grassroots communities to plan, mitigate and respond collectively to environmental, climate-induced and artificial shocks and hazards in way that reduces their dependence on external assistance. When D.E.M.T. looks into the future, it sees resilient rural communities that are capable of self-organising and respond to their own challenges with minimal external support.\nVision\n Creating resilient and sustainably developed communities \nMission\nTo build the capacities of grassroots communities to plan, mitigate and respond collectively to natural or man-made shocks and hazards\n Our Values\n • Transparency\n • Professionalism\n • Honesty\n • Respect\n • Excellency\n"),

    Post(imageURL: "post1", postName: "The background of establishment", postText: "D.E.M.T. was established in 2019 in response to recurrent droughts, epidemics and poor governance of black granite mining in Mutoko rural district which has caused conflict between rural women and their councillors and other leaders. The organization has been implementing projects in Mutoko for various donor agencies including UNOPS, Civic Forum for Human Rights, SUN Civil Society Network and Save the Children UK. All of the projects implemented by D.E.M.T. from 2019 are still functional and some have grown in size and benefits to their owners. Partnerships with these various funders have improved the capacity of D.E.M.T.’s systems, staff, policies and safe guarding mechanisms in both financial management and programming. \n Mutoko. Mudzi and UMP districts in Mashonaland East province are commonly known to be in the chronic drought prone regions of Zimbabwe, which are exposed to recurring socio-economic and environmental shocks. Against this background of harsh climactic conditions, scarcity of key resources and a host of other challenges, people and livelihoods in these districts highly depend on climate regulated agriculture. The communities` high dependence on agriculture, which is sensitive to climactic shocks and stresses, has led to severe loss of livelihoods, thus keeping the residents in vicious cycle of poverty. The districts are also hotspots for epidemics such as malaria, cholera, TB, HIV and malnutrition. In addition, Mutoko, Mudzi, Murehwa and UMP districts are giant mining areas hosting several large scale black granite mining companies and other small scale gold mining companies whose operations are a large and pernicious contributor to the destruction of the local ecosystem. Destructive mining activity in the region has largely resulted in environmental degradation, health hazards, chemical spills and seepage, and widespread deforestation.\n Partnerships\n D.E.M.T. embraces collaboration with other NGOs, CSOs, CBOs, FBOs and relevant government departments in implementing development programs. These collaborations enable D.E.M.T. to leverage the experience and expertise of other, to lessen the possibility of effort duplication, trial and error and to promote upscaling of good practice\n Affiliations\n D.E.M.T. is one of the anchor CBOs in district level communities, such as Mutoko District Community Based Organizations Network (MCBON), Mutoko District Food and Nutrition Security Committee (DFNSC), and Mutoko District Gender Forum (MDGF), a multi-sectorial body which coordinates civil society responses to gender based violence and human rights abuses. D.E.M.T. is also a member os the Zimbabwe Civil Society Organizations for Scaling Up Nutrition Alliance (ZCSOSUNA), an alliance of over 20 local and international NGOs implementing nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive interventions.D.E.M.T. is one of the anchor CBOs in district level communities, such as Mutoko District Community Based Organizations Network (MCBON), Mutoko District Food and Nutrition Security Committee (DFNSC), and Mutoko District Gender Forum (MDGF), a multi-sectorial body which coordinates civil society responses to gender based violence and human rights abuses.

    Post(imageURL: "post1", postName: "Our Approach", postText: "D.E.M.T. uses a resilience based perspective in all its programmes to address key community challenges such as poverty, health, and other well-being outcomes. Its strategy for building resilience capacity integrates elements of emergency response, disaster risk reduction, climate adaptation and livelihood approaches to help vulnerable households and communities to plan for and cope with shocks. D.E.M.T.`s long term approach to building resilience to economic and climactic shocks focuses on 3 critical pillars of rural livelihoods namely; smallholder farming, natural resources management and social safety nets.\n Humanitarian Assitance\n When food insecurity is high, it is common for households to employ negative coping strategies such as reducing the number of meals consumed per day, and for prostitution and early marriages to occur. D.E.M.T. provides humanitarian assistance (short term relief) to the most vulnerable households in disaster situations to avoid loss of lives, GBV, prostitution, and early marriages\nSupporting smallholder farmers\nIn situations of extreme poverty, access to food is power. D.E.M.T. is supporting women and youth farmers with agricultural equipment and trainings in adaptable crop varieties in order to strengthen their risk coping mechanisms and sustainably improves communities` access to food\nCooperatively owned community bakeries\nD.E.M.T. is supporting rural women who have limited access to opportunities for income generation and employment to earn a living as a means to access and service their basic needs. Our goal is to help communities achieve sustainable and resilient food, nutrition and income security. The cooperatively owned community bakeries are also a strategy to reduce GBV and promote the financial independence of disadvantaged rural women\nNourishing People and the Planet Together\nD.E.M.T., in partnership with Resilience40, is teaching schoolchildren the responsible use and protection of the natural environment so that they can become better environmental stewards. Our aim is to promote practices that enhance ecosystem resilience and human well being"),
